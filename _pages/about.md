I'm currently a postdoc research fellow working with Deniz Vatansever at the Fudan University. I completed my PhD with Gaolang Gong at Beijing Normal University.

I have been engaged in cognitive neuroscience research based on multimodal magnetic resonance brain imaging, systematically exploring and analyzing the lateralized organizational patterns of cortical functional networks in the human brain. Since joined the ISTBI, he has been focused on using cutting-edge analytical methods to investigate human brain activities and connectivities during different cognitive task, related to the neuroaesthetics as well as spatial navigation and learning.
